# Lesson 3: Basic Arithmetic Operations

## Objectives:
- Learn how to use basic arithmetic operators in Python: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Materials:
- Python installed or access to an online interpreter.

## Lesson Plan:

1. **Introduction to Arithmetic Operators:**
   - Explain the four basic operators:
     - `+` for addition
     - `-` for subtraction
     - `*` for multiplication
     - `/` for division

2. **Examples:**
   ```python
   # Addition
   result = 5 + 3
   print(result)  # Output: 8

   # Subtraction
   result = 10 - 4
   print(result)  # Output: 6

   # Multiplication
   result = 7 * 2
   print(result)  # Output: 14

   # Division
   result = 8 / 2
   print(result)  # Output: 4
