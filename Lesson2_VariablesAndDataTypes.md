# Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types in Python

## Objectives:
- Understand what variables are and how to use them.
- Learn the basic data types in Python: strings, integers, floats, and booleans.

## Materials:
- Python installed on the computer or access to an online Python environment like Repl.it.

## Lesson Plan:

1. **Introduction to Variables:**
   - Explain that variables are like containers used to store data.
   - Example:
     ```python
     name = "Alice"
     age = 15
     height = 5.5
     ```
   - Discuss that `name` is a string, `age` is an integer, and `height` is a float.

2. **Data Types:**
   - **Strings** (text):
     ```python
     my_name = "John"
     ```
   - **Integers** (whole numbers):
     ```python
     my_age = 16
     ```
   - **Floats** (decimal numbers):
     ```python
     pi = 3.14
     ```
   - **Booleans** (True or False values):
     ```python
     is_student = True
     ```

3. **Practice Activity:**
   - Have students declare their own variables: their name (string), age (integer), height (float), and if they are a student (boolean).
   - Example:
     ```python
     my_name = "Sophia"
     my_age = 14
     my_height = 5.2
     is_student = True
     ```

4. **Homework:**
   - Create variables for three different favorite things (e.g., color, food, hobby) and print them using the `print()` function.
